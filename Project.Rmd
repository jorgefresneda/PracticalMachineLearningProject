##Introduction

 
 In this project, we are going to analyse data about weight lifted exercises coming from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. In this experiment, the team asked a number of non-experienced weight lifters to exercise either correctly or incorrectly, but with a specific error. The exercise was supervied by an experienced trainer to ensure it was performed either correctly or with the right error.
 
The data is loaded like this:
 
```{r}
 # Libraries needed for the whole study
 library(ggplot2)
 library(caret)
 library(dplyr)
 library(randomForest)
-
library(doMC)
registerDoMC(cores=4)
```
```{r}
 data <- tbl_df(read.csv("pml-training.csv"))
dim(data)
 ```
